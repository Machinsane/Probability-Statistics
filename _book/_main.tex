To check out if 2 events are independent, we can use the definition: If A and B are independent, then P(A\textbar B) = P(A\textbar\textasciitilde B) = P(A) To make it clear, ``plays Pink Floyd'' is considered as event B, ``plays Johnny cash'' is event A.

So, in this case P(A) = 6\%, P(A\textbar B) = 10.5\%, P(A\textbar not B) = 5.5\%; clearly, they are not equal. Therefore, they are not independent and seem to have positive relationship.

Or we can check it by if P(B) = P(B\textbar A) = P(B\textbar\textasciitilde A)

Clearly, P(B) = 10.5\%, P(B\textbar A) = 18.3\%, and P(B\textbar\textasciitilde A) = 10\%, so they are not close to each other.

Undoubtedly, from this statistics, humor and danger are absolutely not independent because P(danger) ≠ P(danger\textbar funny) ≠ P(danger\textbar not funny)

It seems that humor are indeed more or less a indication of danger for this ads, because under the condition that ads are funny, the probability of danger seems to be higher than unconditional probability and under the another condition that ads are not funny, the probability of it shows way much lower than unconditional probability.

P(animals = TRUE \textbar{} use\_sex = FALSE) = 37\%

From the probability tables and unconditional probability, I think animals and use\_sex are statistically independent.My argument is that the unconditional probability of animals seems to be very close to the conditional probabilities on both conditions that using sex and not using, which, from definition, shows this 2 events are independent.

From the table, we can know that:

P(celebrity = TRUE \textbar{} patriotic = TRUE) = 29\%

P(celebrity = TRUE \textbar{} patriotic = FALSE) = 29\%

Similar with Part B, in this part, the unconditional probability of celebrity is nearly equal to the 2 conditional probabilities of both showing patriotic contents and not showing this. Thus, they are independent on the basis of this data.

Above is the histogram plot that shows course evaluation scores of all professors.

X axis shows the evaluation scores which professors have gained.

Y axis shows tha counting of each score.

We can see around 4 is where the most scores are sited. So I guess that most UT's professor are pretty good so that they can get good evaluations scores from students.

\hypertarget{part-b-2}{%

\includegraphics{_main_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-18-1.pdf}

The left red box represents the non-native English speaker.

The right blue box stands for native speaker. Y axis means the evaluation scores.

So, from this boxplot, we can conclude that native speakers generally get better score than non-native speaker.

\hypertarget{part-c-1}{%
\subsubsection{Part C}\label{part-c-1}}

I think that the physical attraction basically has slightly positive relationship with evaluation scores but cannot be a predictive indicator of evaluation.

\hypertarget{plot-a}{%
\subsubsection{Plot A}\label{plot-a}}

\includegraphics{_main_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-23-1.pdf}

In this plot, x axis stands for the 24 hours in a single day. 0 is midnight and 10 is 10a.m., so on so forth.

Y is the average ridership of each hour throughout all days in this data.

We can see that the average ridership around morning rush hour and afternoon rush hour are 2 peaks. Also, it remains fairly high during daytime but swiftly decreases in the evening.

\hypertarget{plot-b}{%
\subsubsection{Plot B}\label{plot-b}}

\includegraphics{_main_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-24-1.pdf}

X and Y axis basically are the same as the plot A.

0 means weekends and holidays, while 1 means workdays. Workdays' pattern is pretty close to plot A and it complies with common sense. But non-holidays' pattern are quite different from Plot days, people tends to use bikes around noon till afternoon. I guess that people are likely to hang out during this time.

\hypertarget{plot-c}{%
\subsubsection{Plot C}\label{plot-c}}

\includegraphics{_main_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-25-1.pdf}

0 and 1 has the same meaning as Part B.

X axis means weather situation where 1 means sunny day, 2 means cloudy and misty day, and 3 means light snowy and light rainy day.

Y axis represents the avarage ridership around 9a.m.

So, in non-workdays, when the weather becomes cloudy, a few people may not go out riding bike because they might think that there will be potential rains. However, in workdays, almost all people will not change their original plan, which is getting a bike, just because of potential rains. They have to work!

Caption: Above is the the combination of line plots above, each plot stands for a day in week. x-axis means the hours throughout a day from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. The y-axis means the average boarding. We have 3 lines in each plot, representing 3 months from September to November. Orange line shows September, green line shows October, and blue line shows November.

Answer: From the combination of plots above, I found that the peak boarding from Monday to Friday are quite similar because these five days are workdays; students, teachers, and staffs are taking regular routines in these days. But, on weekend, the boarding curves become so flat because of no class and no work at school.

My reason for that the average boarding on Monday in September is lower than the other 2 months is September has a lot of new students coming. Most new students just know new friends and maybe hanging out with new friends on Sunday night. So, on Monday, they probably could not get up early enough to catch up a bus. That is why the average boarding on Monday is quite less than the other 2 months.

The average boarding on Weds/Thurs/Fri in November looks lower. I guess it is related to the Halloween Holiday. As we know, in Halloween, we have a short break and most people definitely do not come to school. Thus, undoubtedly, the average boarding should be lower.

\hypertarget{plot-2}{%
\subsubsection{Plot 2}\label{plot-2}}

\includegraphics{_main_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-29-1.pdf}

Caption: This combination of scatter plots shows the relationship between boarding number and temperature. The x-axis is temperature of each section and the y-axis is the boarding amount during each 15min section. Also each faceted plot stands for each hour from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. e.g.~the first plot has a ``6'' above, which means 6 a.m. and the last plot has a 21 above which means 9 p.m.

Answer: Actually, I did not see any trend alongside with temperature. In each hour of days, the points distribution seems to be very chaotic and ruleless. Therefore, I dare to say temperature has no solid effect on the number of UT student boarding the bus.

Caption: This is a line graph which shows the total amount of unique songs appearing in the Billboard Top 100 in each year from 1959 to 2020. x-axis represents the year and y-axis stands for the number of the songs.

Comment: I found that around the middle of 1960s, there was a peak which a lot of songs appearing in the Top List. I guess that one of potential reasons is that in these years, the hippie movement arose and gradually dominated the United States. Alongside with this movement, a lot of genres of music, like Rock\&Roll, R\&B, was becoming more and more popular. So during this time, songs were pretty diverse. Another rising trend seems to happen after 2010, maybe just because of globalization, songs from other cultures, such as K-pop, Latin, are becoming more and more public.

Let me put \emph{age = 55} i.e \emph{x = 55} into the equation \emph{y(creatinine) = 147.81 - 0.62x}. We can get:

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 113.71
\end{verbatim}

So, we expect that a 55-year-old person has 113.71 ml/min creatinine clearance rate.

\hypertarget{part-b-4}{%
\subsubsection{Part B}\label{part-b-4}}

The coefficient of age told us that when we grow up 1 year, we expect to decrease 0.62 ml/min of creatinine clearance rate. i.e.~-0.62 ml/min per year.

Real rate: 112 ml/min

So, we can know the difference between real creatinine clearance rate for the 40-year-old is \emph{135-123.01 = 11.99} and the difference between real creatinine clearance rate for the 60-year-old is \emph{112 - 110.61 = 1.39}. So from these two difference 11.99 is bigger than 1.39, we can say the 40-year old is healthier.

Let us look another comparison, the comparative rate which defines as \emph{difference/expected value}:

For the 40:

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 0.097
\end{verbatim}

For the 60:

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 0.013
\end{verbatim}

So, the rate of the 40 is almost 9 times of the rate of the 60, which means the 40 is comparatively healthier than the expected value for 40.

In conclusion, the 40-year-old is healthier than the 60-year-old in terms of creatinine clearance rate.

\subsubsection{Part B}\label{part-b-5}}

Since each time of throwing a dice is independent, we can treat throwing a dice twice as independent events.

For the probability of getting the sum of 2 number is odd, we have 2 scenarios: First, first time is a even and second time is a odd; the other is converse. So the probability of this event should be \emph{P(odd) * P(even) + P(even) * P(odd)}, which is

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 0.5
\end{verbatim}

For the probability of the sum of 2 number is less than 7, we can go through case by case. If we get 1 at first time, we can get 1,2,3,4,5 at the second time, the probability of it should be 1/6 * 5/6 = 5/36. If we get 2 at first time, we can get 1,2,3,4 at the second time, the P of it should be 1/6 * 4/6 = 4/36. If getting 3 at the first time, the P should be 1/6 * 3/6 = 3/36. If 4, then 1/6 * 2/6 = 2/36. If 5, then 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36. If 6, no chance to get less than 7, so the P is 0. Then we add up these probabilities, we can get

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 0.417
\end{verbatim}

So the chance to get the sum of 2 numbers less than 7 is about 42\%

In this cas, we can go through case by case again. If we get 1 at first time, we can get 2,4 at the second time, 2 cases here. If we get 2 at first time, we can get 1,3 at the second time, 2 cases hear. If getting 3 at the first time, we can get 2 at second time, then 1 case. If 4, then get 1 at second time, still 1 case. If 5, then 0. Then we add up these case, we can get 6 case.

The total case is 6 * 6=36, and the chance of getting odd number is 0.5, so the odd case is 0.5 * 36 = 18.

Thus, the P(\textless7\textbar the number is odd) = 6/18 = 1/3

If they are independent, then P(A\textbar B) = P(A), but here, P(\textless7) = 0.42 and P(\textless7\textbar odd) = 0.33. Therefore, they are not independent apparently.

P(no) = 0.35

What we need to get: P(yes\textbar TC)

P(yes) = P(RC) * P(yes\textbar RC) + P(TC) * P(yes\textbar TC), which is 0.65 = 0.3 * 0.5 + 0.7 * x

What we need to get: P(disease\textbar positive) by Bayes Rule

P(positive\textbar non-disease) = 1 - P(negative\textbar non-disease) = 0.0001

P(positive) = P(positive\textbar disease) * P(disease) + P(positive\textbar non-disease) * P(non-disease) =

\hypertarget{problem-5-modeling-soccer-games-with-th-poisson-distribution}{%
\subsection{Problem 5 Modeling soccer games with th Poisson distribution}\label{problem-5-modeling-soccer-games-with-th-poisson-distribution}}

In order to answer the question what are the estimated probabilities of win/lose/draw results between 2 teams, we need to use the Probability Mass Function of Poisson Distribution to calculate the probabilities of all possible goals for both teams.

The PMF of Poisson distribution takes the following form:

\[
P(X=x)=(λ^x/x!)e^−λ
\]

λ means the expected goals for each team and event X means how many goals scored in a game.

Approach: First, I need to make an assumption that the goals scored by each team is an independent event. So, when a probability of a game score(like 2-1) should be the probability of first team scoring 2 goals times the probability of second team scoring 1 goal.

Find the λ (expected goal by a team) by the formula:

\textbf{The team's attach power * The rival's defense weakness * Home/away boost}, in which:

Attach power = The total goals for a team in a season/the average goals of all teams in a season

Defense weakness = The total goals lost by a team in a season/the average goals lost of all teams in a season

Home boost = the average goals for all home teams in a match

Away boost = the average goals for all away teams in a match

After we get λ, we need to use PMF of Poisson to calculate a probabilty of an outcome. For example:

Set team A's λ is 1.5 and team B's λ is 1.7, then the goal for A is Xa and the goal for B is Xb.

Since Xa and Xb are independent, we have

\[
P(Xa=2,Xb=1) = (1.5^2/2!)e^−1.5 * (1.7^1/1!)e^−1.7
\]

With just a little bit more work, we can use calculate the probability of all possible outcomes up to a rip-roaring (but very unlikely) 7-7 draw by `tibble', `expand', `mutate' functions in R.

Then, we have a table for all probabilities of games from 0-0 to 7-7 (64 outcomes). Then by `filter' function, we can calculate the probability of each scenario(win/lose/draw).

\textbf{Next, Let me calculate the home/away boost, and seasonal average goals for further use}

The average number of goals scored i.e.~conceded by teams is (all the goals/20 teams):

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 53.6

The home boost is

\begin{verbatim}

The CDF's plot shows above. X is the event, and Y-axis shows the cumulative probability.

We can conclude that:

\[
P(2< X ≤ 4.5) = P(X = 3) = 0.1

\[
P(2 ≤ X < 4.5) = P(X = {2,3}) = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2.

\[
P(X^2 ≤ 0.25) = P (X ≤ \sqrt{0.25}) = P(X≤ 0.5)
\]

Since it follows a uniform distribution, then by the formula

\[
P(X≤ 0.5) = \frac{0.5-0}{1-0} = 0.5
\]

\hypertarget{ii}{%

We have to make clear that 0 \textless{} a \textless{} 1, otherwise it will fail to get a probability.

\[
P(X^2 ≤ a) = P (X ≤ \sqrt{a}) = \frac{\sqrt{a}-0}{1-0} = \sqrt{a}
\]

\hypertarget{iii}{%
\paragraph{(iii)}\label{iii}}

From part (ii), we know that

\[
P(Y≤ y) = P(X^2 ≤ y) = P (X ≤ \sqrt{y}) = \frac{\sqrt{y}-0}{1-0} = \sqrt{y}
\]

So the CDF of Y is:

\[
F(y) = \sqrt{y}
\]

And then take first-order derivatives to PDF:

\[
f_y(y) = \frac{d(\sqrt{y})}{dy} = \frac{1}{2(\sqrt{y})}
\]

\hypertarget{iiii}{%
\paragraph{(iiii)}\label{iiii}}

Compute E(Y):

\[
E(Y) = \int_{0}^{1} yf(y)dy = \int_{0}^{1} \frac{y}{2(\sqrt{y})}dy =\int_{0}^{1}  \frac{\sqrt{y}}{2}dy = \frac{1}{3}*(1)^\frac{3}{2} - 0 = \frac{1}{3}
\]

In order to compute var(Y), we need to calculate E(Y\^{}2) first.

Compute E(Y\^{}2):

\[
E(Y^2) = \int_{0}^{1} y^2f(y)dy = \int_{0}^{1} \frac{y^2}{2(\sqrt{y})}dy =\int_{0}^{1}  \frac{\sqrt{y^3}}{2}dy = \frac{1}{5}*(1)^\frac{5}{2} - 0 = \frac{1}{5}
\]

Thus, the var(Y) = E(Y\^{}2) - E(Y)\^{}2 as follow:

\[
var(Y) = E(Y^2)- E(Y)^2 = \frac{1}{5} - (\frac{1}{3})^2 = \frac{4}{45}

\[
E(X) = E(Z_1^2+Z_2^2...+Z_d^2) = E(Z_1^2)+E(Z_2^2)+...+E(Z_d^2)
\] Since Z\_1 to Z\_d are all follows the same distribution, we have:

\[
E(Z_1^2) = E(Z_2^2) = ... = E(Z_d^2)
\]

Thus, as long as we get E(Z\_i\^{}2), we are done. So the E(Z\_i\^{}2):

\[
E(Z_i^2) = Var(Z_i) + E(Z_i)^2 = 1 + 0^2 = 1
\]

The we can get E(X):

\[
E(X) =E(Z_1^2)+E(Z_2^2)+...+E(Z_d^2) = \sum_{i = 1}^{d} 1 = d
\]

\hypertarget{part-b-7}{%
\subsubsection{Part B}\label{part-b-7}}

I do not agree with that, because average velocity does not take into account the time spent at different velocities during the entire journey.

Therefore, if we want to figure out the average time, we should calculate the time for walking and biking separately, and then take weighted average of them.

Thus, the time for walking should be:

\[
T(walking) = Distance/Velocity(walking) =2(miles)/5(miles/hour) = 0.4 hour
\]

And the time for biking should be:

\[
T(biking) = Distance/Velocity(biking) =2(miles)/10(miles/hour) = 0.2 hour
\]

And the add in the probabilities of two situations, we have:

\[
T = w(walking)*T(walking) + w(biking)*T(biking) \\= 0.4*0.4 + 0.6*0.2 = 0.16 +0.12 = 0.28 hour = 16.8 minutes

Thus, Markov takes average 0.28 hour, or 16.8 minutes, to get to the class.

Then once we get the CDF, we can get the PDF of it.

\[
f(x) = F'(x) 
\]

Let's look at the detailed case here (0≤u≤1):

\[
F(u) = P(U≤u) = \frac {u-0}{1-0} = u

Since X = F\^{}-1(U), we can see from the picture X and U are identical and all a uniform distribution on {[}0,1{]}. Thus, we can conclude that the pdf of f(x) equals to of f(u) as followed (0≤x≤1):

f(x) = \frac {1}{1-0} = 1

Comments: From the plot above, we can see that, as the observations(N) of experiment increase more and more, the standard deviation become less and less, which matches the standard deviation formula in part (A).

In addition to that, I can find that, as the observations(N) of each experiment increase, the real standard deviations are more close to the theoretical standard deviations.It complies large number theorem.

\[
F_{X_i}(x) = P(X_i≤x) = \int_{0}^{x} \lambda e^{-\lambda t}dt = 1- e^{-\lambda x}
\]

Since max\{X\_i(i=1,2,\ldots,N)\}) \textless{} y is equivalent to X\_i \textless{} y for any i, then we have:

\[
F_{Y_N}(y) = P(Y_N < y) \\= P(max(X_1,X_2...X_N)<y) \\= P(X_1<y,X_2<y,X_3<y...X_N<y)
\]

And then because X itself is independent, then we have:

\[
P(X_1<y,X_2<y,X_3<y...X_N<y) \\= P(X_1<y) *P(X_2<y) *...*P(X_N<y) \\= F_{X_1}(y)*F_{X_2}(y)*...*F_{X_N}(y) \\= (1- e^{-\lambda y})^N

Then, differentiate the CDF of Y\_N, we can get the PDF of Y\_N:

\[
f_{Y_N} = \frac {dF_{Y_N}(y)}{dy} = \frac {d}{dy}(1-e^{\lambda y})^N = N(1-e^{\lambda y})^{N-1}*(-e^{-\lambda y})*-\lambda = N\lambda e^{-\lambda y}(1-e^{-\lambda y})^{N-1}

Approach: I will use t-test to check if the mean of ``happy'' scores for ``Living with Ed'' and ``My Name is Earl'' have any difference. Thus, in this case, the null hypothesis is the mean difference to be 0, which indicates that they do not have any difference in terms of their means of happy ``score''.

Results:

Approach: Likewise, I am going to use t-test to check if they have any difference in terms of the mean of ``annoyed'' scores. Therefore, the null hypothesis is the mean difference to be 0, which suggests that they have no difference on the mean of ``annoyed'' scores.

Results:

## sample estimates:

Conclusion: From the t test summary above, we can see the 95\% confident interval doesn't contain 0, which means our null hypothesis has to be rejected, so they really have difference in annoying level. To be more specific, The ``Apprentice: Los Angeles'' is more annoying than ``The Biggest Loser'', because it has higher average ``annoyed'' score.

\hypertarget{part-c-4}{%
\subsubsection{Part C}\label{part-c-4}}

Question: As we expect, what proportion of American TV audiences would think ``Dancing with the Stars'' is confusing?

Approach: I am going to use proportion test with null hypothesis as P(not confusing) = P(confusing).

Results:

\begin{verbatim}
## 
##  1-sample proportions test with continuity correction
## 
## data:  $  [with success = TRUE]stars  [with success = TRUE]confusing  [with success = TRUE]
## X-squared = 127.65, df = 1, p-value < 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.5
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  0.04453431 0.12893254
## sample estimates:
##          p 
## 0.07734807
\end{verbatim}

Conclusion: From the proportions test summary above, we can see the null hypothesis fails to hold. Also, the 95\% confident interval of actual proportion is from around 4.5\% to 12.9\%. In other words, The proportion of American audiences we expect to be befuddled by ``Dancing with the Stars'' falls into range between 4.5\% to 12.9\% with 95\% confidence level.

\hypertarget{problem-2-ebay}{%
\subsection{Problem 2 Ebay}\label{problem-2-ebay}}

Question: Does the difference of revenue ratios between treatment group and control group indicate the paid search advertising on Google generates more revenue for EBay?

Approach: I am going to bootstrap 10000 times of mean of revenue ratios for both treatment group and control group, and then compute their differences. Once I have 10000 times of differences, I can create a 95\% confidence interval of all differences to see whether 0 falls in to it or not. If 0 is in the interval, I can conclude that no significant evidence shows that paid search advertising boosts the revenue for EBay. If the interval falls into positive side, than I can say that paid search advertising diminish the revenue. If the interval falls into negative side, than I can say that paid search advertising boosts the revenue.

Results:

Let us see the histogram of the 10000 times bootstrap of the revenue ratio difference between treatmentgroup and control group:

\includegraphics{_main_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-93-1.pdf}

\begin{verbatim}
##     name       lower       upper level     method    estimate
## 1 result -0.08978001 -0.01338304  0.95 percentile -0.05228145
\end{verbatim}

Conclusion: From the summary above, we can see the 95\% confidence interval falls below 0, which means with 95\% confident level, the real difference between the revenue ratio mean of treatment group and control group is in the range of around -9\% and -1\%. Thus, I conclude that paid search advertising does boost the revenue.

\hypertarget{problem-3-iron-bank}{%
\subsection{Problem 3 Iron Bank}\label{problem-3-iron-bank}}

In the case, I set the null hypothesis as that the proportion of flagged trades from Iron Bank is the same as 2.4\%. In other words, they were clean under this algorithm.

My test statistic will be the proportion of flagged trades out of 2021 in each simulation.

Let us get into the simulation part. First, the histogram below shows distribution of the proportion in 100000 simulations:

\includegraphics{_main_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-96-1.pdf}

Next, let us look at the P-value:

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 0.000224
\end{verbatim}

As we see, the P value is around 0.02\%, which means given that the null hypothesis is true, the chance of observing the number of flagged trades to be equal to or larger than 70 should be around 0.02\%. It is very close to 0, so the null hypothesis fails to hold so that we claim that Iron Bank violated the ``Inside Trading'' laws.

One\_sentence conclusion: If the P value is larger than 2.5\%, then the null hypothesis will look plausible to me.

Defensive statements: My presumptive confidence level is 95\% and since this is one-side test, we should ignore the probability on the lower extreme side. Therefore, 95\% confidence interval + 2.5\%(the chance of the other extreme side) = 97.5\%. Thus, if the P value here is larger than 2.5\%, then it would be in 95\% confidence interval. Hence, the null hypothesis fails to be rejected. Therefore, I would claim that there is not a significant evidence showing that the proportion of flagged trades from Iron Bank is not 2.4\%.

Caption: This figure shows 10000 times bootstrap of linear regression of demand on the price. X-axis represents the price elasticity of demand and the y-axis stands for count for the values of the price elasticity of demand. In this graph, `lower Bound' means the lower bound of 95\% confidence interval and `Upper Bound' means the upper bound of 95\% confidence interval. Thus, the whole 95\% confidence interval is from `lower Bound' to `Upper Bound'.

\hypertarget{i-1}{%
\paragraph{i}\label{i-1}}

First, we have

\[
E(\hat{p}-\hat{q}) = E(\hat{p})-E(\hat{q})
\]

Then, we have

\[
E(\hat{p}) = E(\overline{X_N}) = E(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i}{N}) = \frac{Np}{N} = p
\]

Also, we have

\[
E(\hat{q}) = E(\overline{Y_M}) = E(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{M} Y_i}{M}) = \frac{Mq}{M} = q
\]

Thus, we have

\[
E(\hat{p}-\hat{q}) = E(\hat{p})-E(\hat{q})=p-q
\]

\hypertarget{ii-1}{%
\paragraph{ii}\label{ii-1}}

As we know, the variance of a random variable X following Bernoulli distribution should be:

\[
Var(X) = p(1-p)
\]

\[
Var(\hat{p}) = Var(\overline{X_N}) = Var(\frac{X_1+X_2+...+X_N}{N})\\=\frac{1}{N^2}\sum_{i=1}^{N}Var(X_i) = \frac{1}{N^2}*Np(1-p)=\frac{p(1-p)}{N}
\]

Thus, the standard deviation should be

\[
Std(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{N}}
\]

\hypertarget{iii-1}{%
\paragraph{iii}\label{iii-1}}

Following the same logic, we have

\[
Var(\hat{q}) =\frac{q(1-q)}{M}
\]

Thus, we have

\[
Var(\hat{\triangle})= Var((\hat{p}-\hat{q})=Var(\hat{p})-Var(\hat{q}) = \frac{p(1-p)}{N}-\frac{q(1-q)}{M}
\]

Therefore, we have

\[
Std(\hat{\triangle}) = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{N}-\frac{q(1-q)}{M}}
\]

\hypertarget{part-b-10}{%
\subsubsection{Part B}\label{part-b-10}}

The expected value of this estimator should be

\[
E(\hat{\triangle}) = E(\overline{X_N}-\overline{Y_M})=E(\overline{X_N})-E(\overline{Y_M})=\mu_X-\mu_Y
\]

The standard error of this estimator should be

\[
Std(\hat{\triangle}) = \sqrt{Var(\hat{\triangle})}=\sqrt{Var(\overline{X_N}-\overline{Y_M})}=\sqrt{Var(\overline{X_N})-Var(\overline{Y_M})}\\=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N^2}\sum_{i=1}^{N}Var(X_i)+\frac{1}{M^2}\sum_{i=1}^{M}Var(Y_i)}=\sqrt{\frac{N}{N^2}{\sigma_X}^2+\frac{M}{M^2}{\sigma_Y}^2}=\sqrt{\frac{{\sigma_X}^2}{N}-\frac{{\sigma_Y}^2}{M}}
